## 🚀 Quick Start

Copy and run this to test your setup:

```python
from Syrin import Agent
from Syrin.model import Model

class MyAgent(Agent):
    model = Model.OpenAI("gpt-4o-mini")
    system_prompt = "You are helpful."

agent = MyAgent()
response = agent.response("Hello! How are you?")
print(response.content)
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Agent
A program that can talk to AI, remember things, and do tasks.

### Tools
Special functions your agent can call (search, calculate, etc.)

### Memory
Agents can remember past conversations and learn preferences.

### Budget
Control how much money your agent can spend on AI API calls.

### Streaming
Get responses in real-time instead of waiting.

### Hooks
Execute code at specific moments during agent execution.

### Observability
Trace and debug agent execution with spans and sessions.
