# Syrin Documentation

Welcome to the **Syrin** library! Build powerful AI agents with budgets, memory, and more.

## 📚 Start Here

**New to Syrin?** Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) - a beginner-friendly guide.

**Want to run your agent?** Serving is built-in. Serve via **HTTP** (`agent.serve(port=8000)`), **CLI** (`agent.serve(protocol=ServeProtocol.CLI)`), or the **playground** (`enable_playground=True`). See traces with `debug=True` or `--trace`. → [Serving](serving.md) · [Playground](playground.md)

**Group tools in MCP?** Define an MCP server with `@tool` methods and add it to your agent: `tools=[ProductMCP()]`. MCP tools become agent tools. → [MCP](mcp.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Copy and run this to test your setup:

```python
from syrin import Agent, Model

# Recommended: Builder or presets
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You are helpful.").build()
# Or: agent = Agent.basic(Model.Almock())
response = agent.response("Hello! How are you?")
print(response.content)
```

**Try it in the playground:** `agent.serve(port=8000, enable_playground=True)` → visit http://localhost:8000/playground  
**See traces:** Add `debug=True` to your agent, or run `python my_agent.py --trace`

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Agent
A program that can talk to AI, remember things, and do tasks.

### Tools
Special functions your agent can call (search, calculate, etc.)

### Memory
Agents can remember past conversations and learn preferences.

### Budget
Control how much money your agent can spend on AI API calls.

### Streaming
Get responses in real-time instead of waiting.

### Hooks
Execute code at specific moments during agent execution.

### Observability
Trace and debug agent execution with spans and sessions. Use `debug=True` or `--trace` to see LLM calls, tool calls, and costs in the console.
