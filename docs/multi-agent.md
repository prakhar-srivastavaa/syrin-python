# Use Case 5: Multi-Agent Orchestration

## What You'll Learn

How to create **multiple agents that work together**. Perfect for:
- Complex workflows
- Specialized teams
- Parallel processing
- Handoffs between agents

Instead of one agent doing everything, use specialized agents working as a team!

## The Idea

```
Task: "Write and proofread a blog post"
  ↓
Writer Agent: Creates the blog post
  ↓
Editor Agent: Proofreads and improves it
  ↓
Final Article: Ready to publish!
```

## Complete Example: Copy & Paste This!

```python
"""
Multi-Agent Team Example
Copy this code and run it!

## Sequential Processing (Pipeline)

Process tasks one after another:

"""

## Parallel Processing

## Agent Specialization

Each agent focuses on one thing:

```python

    if user and user.password == password:

## Agent with Delegation

One agent delegating to others:

```python

"""

from Syrin.threshold import BudgetThreshold


shared_budget = Budget(

## Best Practices

### 1. Each Agent One Job

```python
# ✓ Good - focused responsibility
class WriterAgent(Agent):
    system_prompt = "Write content only."

# ❌ Not good - too many responsibilities
class JackOfAllTradesAgent(Agent):
    system_prompt = "Write, edit, review, publish everything."
```

### 2. Clear Communication

```python
# ✓ Good - structured output
response = agent.response("Write a 3-paragraph article about Python")

# ❌ Not good - ambiguous
response = agent.response("Write about Python")
```

### 3. Appropriate Tools

```python
# ✓ Good - agents have right tools
writer_agent.tools = [save_text, format_text]
editor_agent.tools = [save_text, check_grammar]

# ❌ Not good - wrong tools
writer_agent.tools = [delete_database, send_email]
```

### 4. Handle Failures

```python
try:
    response = agent.response(prompt)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Agent failed: {e}")
    # Use backup agent or retry
```
