# Syrin: Getting Started for Beginners

Welcome to **Syrin**! This guide will help you understand the basics and get your first agent running in minutes.

## What is Syrin?

Think of Syrin as a toolkit for building **AI agents** - programs that can talk to AI (like ChatGPT), remember conversations, do tasks, and control their own costs.

**In simple terms:**
- An **Agent** is a program that can ask an AI questions and get answers
- An **Agent** can remember what happened before (memory)
- An **Agent** can do real work (like search the web, send emails, etc.) using **Tools**
- An **Agent** can have a budget so it doesn't spend too much money

## Installation

```bash
pip install syrin
```

Set your API key (or use `Model.Almock()` to run without one — see [Models Guide](models.md#almock-an-llm-mock)):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude, OPENROUTER_API_KEY for OpenRouter
```

## Your First Completion (Easiest)

The simplest way to get started: call a model directly. No Agent, no classes — just a few lines. Use this when you only need simple Q&A; use an Agent when you need tools, memory, or budget control.

```python
import os
from syrin import Model
from syrin.types import Message
from syrin.enums import MessageRole

# model = Model.OpenAI("gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
model = Model.Almock()  # No API Key needed
messages = [
    Message(role=MessageRole.SYSTEM, content="You are helpful."),
    Message(role=MessageRole.USER, content="What is 2 + 2?"),
]
response = model.complete(messages)
print(response.content)  # "4" or "The answer is 4"
```

Use `await model.acomplete(messages)` for async. See the [Models Guide](models.md) for more.

## Your First Agent (30 seconds)

For prompts with tools, memory, or budget, use an Agent. **Recommended:** use the Builder or presets:

```python
from syrin import Agent, Model

# Option 1: Builder (recommended for most agents)
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You are helpful.").build()

# Option 2: Preset (quick path)
agent = Agent.basic(Model.Almock(), system_prompt="You are helpful.")

# Option 3: Class-based (for named agent types)
class SimpleAgent(Agent):
    model = Model.Almock()
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
agent = SimpleAgent()

response = agent.response("What is 2 + 2?")
print(response.content)  # Output: "4" or "The answer is 4"
```

That's it! Prefer `Agent.builder()` when adding tools, budget, or memory.

### Quick copy-paste examples

```python
from syrin import Agent, Budget
from syrin.memory import Memory

# Minimal agent (no API key: Model.Almock())
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You are helpful.").build()

# Agent with tools
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You search and calculate.").with_tools([search, calculate]).build()

# Agent with budget ($0.50 per run)
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You are concise.").with_budget(Budget(run=0.50)).build()

# Agent with memory (multi-turn)
agent = Agent.builder(Model.Almock()).with_system_prompt("You remember context.").with_memory(Memory()).build()
```

**Tip:** You can tweak model properties: `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `context_window`, etc. See the [Models Guide](models.md) for the full list.

## Serving is easy — HTTP, CLI, or playground

Once you have an agent, you can serve it via **HTTP** (API), **CLI** (terminal REPL), or the **web playground**. Serving is built-in — no extra wiring.

### HTTP (default) — Production API

```python
agent.serve(port=8000)  # POST /chat, POST /stream, GET /health, etc.
```

Use for webhooks, chatbots, production APIs.

### CLI REPL — Terminal testing

```python
from syrin.enums import ServeProtocol

agent.serve(protocol=ServeProtocol.CLI)
# Interactive prompt in the terminal — type messages, see responses and cost
```

Use for local dev and interactive testing.

### Web playground (easiest way to test)

Install `syrin[serve]` and add one line:

```bash
uv pip install syrin[serve]
```

```python
agent = SimpleAgent()
agent.serve(port=8000, enable_playground=True)
# Visit http://localhost:8000/playground — chat, see cost, budget, and traces
```

Visit **http://localhost:8000/playground** to chat with your agent, see cost per message, and (when `debug=True`) inspect traces in real time.

### CLI REPL (terminal testing)

```python
from syrin.enums import ServeProtocol

agent.serve(protocol=ServeProtocol.CLI)
# Interactive prompt in the terminal — type messages, see responses and cost
```

### See what’s happening: `debug=True` or `--trace`

Use **`debug=True`** to print traces to the console:

```python
agent = SimpleAgent(debug=True)
response = agent.response("Hello!")
# You'll see spans: agent.run, llm.request, tool.call, etc.
```

Or run any script with **`--trace`** to enable trace output:

```bash
python my_agent.py --trace
```

Traces show LLM calls, tool calls, memory ops, and costs — no extra setup.

### What just happened?

1. We created a class called `SimpleAgent` that inherited from `Agent`
2. We told it which AI model to use (`gpt-4o-mini` - cheap and fast)
3. We told it how to behave (`system_prompt`)
4. We asked it a question using `agent.response()`
5. We got back a response with the answer

## Next Steps

**Want to serve your agent?** Add `agent.serve(port=8000, enable_playground=True)` and open http://localhost:8000/playground. See [Serving](serving.md) and [Playground](playground.md).

**Use `debug=True` or `--trace`** to see traces (LLM calls, tool calls, costs). See [Observability](observability.md).

You can now read the **Use Case Guides** below:

- **[Use Case 1: Simple Q&A Agent](simple-qa-agent.md)** - Ask questions and get answers
- **[Use Case 2: Research Agent with Tools](research-agent-with-tools.md)** - Give your agent the ability to search, calculate, or do other tasks
- **[Use Case 3: Agent with Memory](agent-with-memory.md)** - Make your agent remember past conversations
- **[Use Case 4: Budget Control & Cost Management](budget-control.md)** - Keep your AI spending under control
- **[Use Case 5: Multi-Agent Orchestration](multi-agent.md)** - Create multiple agents that work together
- **[Use Case 6: Streaming & Real-time Updates](streaming.md)** - Get responses as they're being generated

## Important Concepts

### Response Object

When you call `agent.response()`, you get back a `Response` object with useful information:

```python
response = agent.response("Hello!")

response.content         # The actual answer text
response.cost             # How much money was spent (in USD)
response.tokens          # How many tokens were used
response.model           # Which AI model was used
response.duration        # How long it took
```

### Enums (Special Option Lists)

In Syrin, you pass **callbacks** for behavior like "what to do when budget is exceeded". Use the built-in helpers or your own function:

```python
from syrin import Budget, warn_on_exceeded

# Warn and continue when budget exceeded:
budget = Budget(run=1.00, on_exceeded=warn_on_exceeded)

# Or use raise_on_exceeded to stop and raise an error.
```

## Common Questions

**Q: What AI models can I use?**
A: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, and many more. See the model examples in each use case.

**Q: Will this cost me money?**
A: Yes, AI API calls cost money. But you control the budget! See Use Case 4.

**Q: Can my agent remember things?**
A: Yes! See Use Case 3 about Memory.

**Q: How do I make my agent do things like search the web?**
A: Using Tools! See Use Case 2.

**Q: Can I run code while my agent is thinking?**
A: Yes! See Use Case 6 about Streaming.

**Q: How do I serve my agent or try it in a browser?**
A: Use `agent.serve(port=8000, enable_playground=True)` and visit http://localhost:8000/playground. Or use `agent.serve(protocol=ServeProtocol.CLI)` for a terminal REPL. See [Serving](serving.md).

**Q: How do I see what my agent is doing (LLM calls, tools, etc.)?**
A: Use `agent = Agent(..., debug=True)` or run your script with `python my_agent.py --trace`. Traces print to the console.

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key not found"
- Make sure you set your API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`
- Or set it in your code: `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."`

### "Model not found"
- Make sure your API key is correct
- Make sure you have credits in your API account

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure your API key has the right permissions
- Try creating a new key in your API dashboard
