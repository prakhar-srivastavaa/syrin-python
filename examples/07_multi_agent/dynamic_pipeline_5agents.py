"""Dynamic Pipeline — 5+ agents with clear roles and when-to-use instructions.

Demonstrates:
- 5 specialized agents: Researcher, Analyst, Writer, FactChecker, Summarizer
- Orchestrator prompt that says when to use which agent
- DynamicPipeline.run() — LLM plans and spawns agents
- Full observability (run with --trace or attach debugger)

Run from repo root:
  python -m examples.07_multi_agent.dynamic_pipeline_5agents
Visit: http://localhost:8000/playground
Requires: uv pip install syrin[serve]
